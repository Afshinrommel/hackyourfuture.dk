![content](/static/logo-dark.svg)

this is a fork from [Keven repo](`https://github.com/kevinsimper/hackyourfuture.dk`)

to preview on Heroku hosting [`https://hyf-dk.herokuapp.com/`](https://hyf-dk.herokuapp.com/)


### Why Next.js

nodejs is react server-rendering universal-rendering.
It is a framework that most notably allows you to
write server-rendered React apps easily â€“ amongst other cool things.
Also one of the most important features is SEO-friendly.

### Run project
Set the node_env. This is how you do in git bash:
`export NODE_ENV=development`
Now you can run 
`npm run start`
or run
`nodemon`

### project structure refs
The project is depend on Next.js & Express.js, and here is a tutorial
about the same structure using both next.js and express.js
* [custom-server-express](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server-express)
* [external styled jsx sass](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-external-styled-jsx-sass)
* [material UI width nextjs](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs)
#### Website Fonts

there is two basic fonts: Space Mono, and Work Sans

```
 @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Space+Mono|Work+Sans');
 //font-family: 'Space Mono', monospace;
 //font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;
```

#### UI components

Many components are coming from [Material UI](https://material-ui.com)

#### Note

When we navigate between website urls under development, some porplems
appears with navbar and some other places, so we need to restart the server
manually with `npm start dev`
The same issue if we added a new module

## project structure:

![structure](/static/readme/project-structure.png)

- `server.js` is the entry point for this project, which is node.js server based on express.js
- the `backend` folder contains express.js routes where we can connect the database later and create our API
- `static` folder contains the assets like: images, fonts, icons...
- `pages` folder contains the next.js files. Each one of the represent
  a route or a link at the website. For example: about.js file on the root of this folder represents `hackyourfuture.dk/about`
  and so on. We can also make sub-folders contains files to create links like `hackyourfuture/folder-name/file-name`
- `components` folder contains our react components.
  we are importing these components at `pages` files.

### pages content

most of pages content is comming from `components/content/...`
content is stored in these files as variables. and at `pages` we are importing them
`marked` module is used to convert the content from markup to html
and the component `<content>` is the wrapper div for them
example:
  
 ![content](/static/readme/content.png)

Many components are using data coming from `json` files. You can find these files in the same component folder.

**Note:**
_These files are temporary, and the real date will come later from database_

### JSX styling

the default way to add `css` for components with next.js is `jsx`
at the components we can add something like:

```
<style jsx>{`
  body {
    font-size : 16px;
  }
`}
</style>
```

### Navbar
